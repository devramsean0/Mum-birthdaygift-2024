# Hour 5
During this session, I started to plan out the more indetail parts of the wiring, Specifically I was doing the maths on Max current load and testing what's the minimum that the noodles look ok at.
I was also working out what the minimum amount of circuitry required is as I have a short amount of time avaliable (3 weeks, to write code, wire it up and make it look nice)

## Block Schematic

## Future plans
Some kind of PCB, with Mosfets and the MC built into the core, so that it can drive at a migher current so it's brighter)
